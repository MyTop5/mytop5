I first became aware of the English rock band [Pink Floyd](https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd) when I was around 12 years of age. I clearly remember playing my dad's [The Dark Side of the Moon](https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Dark+Side+of+the+Moon) vinyl and being completely blown away by their lyrics and sound.

For the next four years, whenever I got together with my friends to chill and listen to music, inevitably, and to everyoneâ€™s contentment, one or two different Pink Floyd albums would end up in the record player. So one could say that their music has sort of become forever associated with those early teenage years of my life.

As I grew older, I've collected several of their albums and sold them all when I moved abroad, but my love for their music has never wavered. When my oldest daughter turned 17, I introduced her to **Wish You Were Here**, and for the next two or three months, she even started dabbing on her electric guitar, inspired by their music too.

The best part was when a couple of years ago, we both watched [Brit Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brit_Floyd) perform at the [DPAC](https://www.dpacnc.com/). Seeing her singing all of their songs and *genuinely* enjoying the lyrics gave me that sense of a job well done, you know?
